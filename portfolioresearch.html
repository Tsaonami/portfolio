					<p>Even before I entered the site, the website already amazed me. While the main page is loading, the page already interacts with the viewer by reading "loading" and the letters have a vibratory effect to give the viewer a loading feeling.</p></br>

					<p>When you enter the page, the center animation already shapes Daniel Spatzek's personality. His short description on the main page says he's a "night owl from Austria" and transitions to his css award he's won. The design of his main page is simple and yet genius. When you scroll over each page title, to let the user know that the title is being scrolled over, the word expands. The entire page is elegant smooth. It emits a very comfortable and silky smooth feeling. There is a unique transition animation to each page. The amount of transition and where Daniel Spatzek's intent to lead your eyes is breath-taking and a pleasure to indulge in. It's truly amazing. Here's a link to it below.</p></br>
