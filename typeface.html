					<h2>Blog 4</br><span>Typeface</span></h2>

					<p>The internet is an amazing platform. It's filled with colorful pictures, beautiful texts, helpful links, and captivating videos. You can surf the web, email an employer, post a video on YouTube, or book a vacation in the Bajamas. But whatever you do on the internet, there is one aspect of it that is undeniably essential to its success: text. Text on the internet is like a picture with no color. Without proper text, the internet would be a drab, mundane place, just as a picture with no color would be an undescriptive, lifeless item. Text provides fluidity, comfort, memorable user experience, and most importantly, story to whoever reads it. One type of text, called typefaces, that brings color to the picture that we call the internet, is called Futura, one of the most popular typefaces used on the internet.</p></br>

					<p>Futura, like most sans-serif typefaces, is a modern geometric sans-serif typeface designed by Paul Renner in 1927 as a contribution to a public housing project called the New-Frankfurt project. Its style is based on geometric forms such as perfect circles, triangles, and squares that drew influence from the design of the Bauhaus building style of the era. Its characteristics include even strokes throughout its letterforms with low contrast throughout different areas of each letter. Another prominent characteristic is each lowercase letter with an ascender rises above the cap line, rendering them taller than its uppercase letters. Its uppercase letters bear resemblance to ancient Roman capital letters, which provides a standard for contemporary capital letters.</p></br>

					<p>The unique thing about Futura is all-purpose use. It's used today as both display and body texts. It's extremely common in advertisements and logos. Some examples include the Supreme brand, Volkswagen, and IKEA (until 2010). It has also been used in movies such as V for Vendetta in which the typeface was used extensively.</p></br>

					<p>A few websites that utilize Futura in their text arsenal are Dribbble, East Room, and Atlantic Records. Dribbble doesn't exactly use this typeface, however, since it is a social website for different graphic design artists to showcase their work and whatever they're working on, there are over 650 pictures and projects that use Futura as display texts. East Room, on the other hand, uses Futura as its main typeface as it is ubiquitous throughout its entire website. In fact, it's the only typeface they use and it looks amazing. Atlantic Records mainly uses Futura for titles. However, they use a more bold, uppercase font of Futura.</p></br>

					<p>Dribbble and Atlantic websites use Futura sparingly. East Room, on the other hand, fully utilize the typeface. Some may find it overwhelming, but I persnally love it. Usually websites are littered with difference typeface and fonts, but East Room really allows the typeface to reach its full potential, and it's not overwhelming at all, especially compared with other websites that have more text and less concentration on the typefaces. This website is testimony to the fact that Futura can be used for both display and body text purposes, which is very comforting. The typeface provides a very clear, simple composition to the website while maintaining its straightfowardness and sharpness. Its personality higly resembles a sharp businessman who's about to meet a top client, confident, sharp, and undeterred.</p></br>
