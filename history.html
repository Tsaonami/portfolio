					<p>Follow-up Question: How did the development of ARPANET affect society and people’s lives at the time of its creation?</p></br>

					<p>Since ARPANET laid the foundation to the Internet as we know it today, it has had great impact on society and its people. During its advent, it provided an increase in effective, efficient, and instant communication between parties of great distance. It was started and funded by collaborative defense contractors, universities, and government agencies that worked through ARPA’s IPTO, or the Information Processing Technology Office, during the great Cold War in order to communicate and gain technological advantage over the Soviet Union.</p></br>

					<p>After the war, ARPANET has ever since changed the face of telecommunications, bringing together facilities and institutions nationally and internationally. The world, in essence has since grown closer through the Internet.</p></br>

					<blockquote>“In a few years, men will be able to communicate more effectively through a machine than face to face.”</blockquote></br>
								<cite>— J.C.R. Licklider</cite></br>

					</br><p>Licklider couldn’t have been more accurate. Without ARPANET, the Internet wouldn’t exist today, and neither would Facebook, Instagram, Email, or YouTube, all social mediums we use to communicate with each other, whether it be news, entertainment, or sports. Leonard Kleinrock stated, “Connecting computers together was not the thing that made the ARPANET important. Connecting people to computers was important, but far more important was connecting people to people…” No more using telegrams or paper mail to connect with someone from across an entire continent; it would be possible with a click of a finger.</p></br>
