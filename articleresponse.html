					<p>I definitely agree with this article. This article initially advocates humor as a cardinal aspect of life. It can completely flip someone's day the other way around, regardless of what medium it's expressed in; either through real life interaction, the computer, or even a magazine. Victor Yocco then explains what makes something funny and attributes humor to classications of context, situation, and culture. And also he touches base on what doesn't make something funny: when humor is overdone or underdone. Humor can also slow people down, which intuitively doesn't sound positive, but can imprint the experience in the user's memory for more memorable experiences. He then categorizes humor into six groups: comparison, personification, exaggeration, pun, silliness, and surprise. He then delves into how humor and web design can be integrated together, when it's appropriate and not appropriate, and when it may enhance a website or design.</p></br>

					<p>I can relate to it on a personal level because humor is an integral part of my life and personality. I love to make people laugh and I take personal satisfaction if other people consider me funny because I believe that humor is an essential quality to leading an interesting and enjoyable life. Without humor, my life, as well as others I'm sure, would be extremely dull and colorless. In my future, I plan to incorporate humor, when approriate, into my designs and ideas whenever possible!<br/><br/><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/06/connecting-users-humor-web-design/">Read more here on their website!</a></p>
