					<h2>Blog 1</br><span>History</span></br><span>Article</span></h2>

					<time datetime="2017-7-14">June 28, 2017</time>

					<p>My first blog. This is my second time taking this class. Man, is that embarrassing. Whelp...gotta do wutchu gotta do. I plan to ace it this time along with my other class. They're both going down. Anyways. My first blog pertains to information about a follow-up question we concocted in class. It's about ARPANET and how it affected people in the United States.</p></br>

					<h2>Blog 2</br><span>Design Process</span></h2>

					<time datetime="2017-7-14">July 14, 2017</time>

					<p>Second blog. It's July 14, 2017. I'm in Davis for my Interactive Media Design class. It's so frickin' hot...still gotta go to class and get this "A". My teacher just assigned me this blog post for homework. Ugh. Just kidding. Just kidding. Half kidding. We have to write about our Design Process on this composition we have to make for our personal bakery website. Good thing there's air conditioning...Click the ink splatter on the right to read more.</p></br>

					<h2>Blog 3</br><span>Article Response</span></h2>

					<time datetime="2017-7-14">July 14, 2017</time>

					<p>Second blog: It's still hot as hell in Davis. But I'm getting more accustomed to it as each day passes by. Just kidding. I lied. I truly feel sorry for all animate and inanimate objects that are baking in the sun outside. I'm pretty sure they have feelings too. Anyway, for our second blog post we're supposed to talk about our responses to a self-chosen article we're supposed to research, tell why we find it interesting, and essentially respond to it.

					<h2>Blog 4</br><span>Typeface</span></h2>

					<time datetime="2017-7-14">July 18, 2017</time>

					<p>Third blog: Nothing's changed. It's still hot. But some good news bears. I think I'm finally getting used to this HTML thing. I took this class before and it was sooooooo confusing. I was just lost for almost everything, especially the cascading part and which parts get priority over other parts. I think all I had to do was just do something on my own instead of following instructions. Anyways, for this blog post, I'm going to talk about a typeface that I'm interested in. I'll be talking about its history, some websites that are using it, and some other thoughts about it. You know the drill. Click right.</p></br>

					<h2>Blog 5</br><span>Portfolio</span></br><span>Research</span></h2>

					<time datetime="2017-7-14">July 26, 2017</time>

					<p>Fourth blog: Coding is getting easier and easier. I think I'm actually falling in love with it. I think about it all the time. I can't wait until I get home to do it. It's like the platonic girlfriend I've never had. I love her but I can never touch her. The best part is that it will always be there when I want to do it too. It like it because there's so much freedom. I can code the same exact website as someone else, but still code it in my own way. It's awesome. But anyways. This blog post is about a portfolio website that stood out to me and why I chose it. Click...nevermind. You know the drill.</p></br>

					<h2>Blog 6</br><span>Responsive</span></br><span>Layout</span></h2>

					<time datetime="2017-7-14">July 26, 2017</time>

					<p>Fifth blog: My last blog folks. Good news: School is almost over. Bad news: this class is almost over. Loved this class. Most fun I've had in my whole college career. Anyways. This blog is about responsive layouts. I'm going to talk about a website's responsive layout format and how it affects how it's viewed. This time and for the last time, click on the ink and pen set to the right to read more about it.</p></br>
